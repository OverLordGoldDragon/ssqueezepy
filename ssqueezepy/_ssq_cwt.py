    """Calculates the synchrosqueezed Continuous Wavelet Transform of `x`.
    Implements the algorithm described in Sec. III of [1].

    # Arguments:
        x: np.ndarray
            Vector of signal samples (e.g. x = np.cos(20 * np.pi * t))
        wavelet: str / tuple[str, dict] / `wavelets.Wavelet`
            Wavelet sampled in Fourier frequency domain.
                - str: name of builtin wavelet. `ssqueezepy.wavs()`
                - tuple[str, dict]: name of builtin wavelet and its configs.
                  E.g. `('morlet', {'mu': 5})`.
                - `wavelets.Wavelet` instance. Can use for custom wavelet.
        scales: str['log', 'linear'] / np.ndarray
            CWT scales.
                - 'log': exponentially distributed scales, as pow of 2:
                         `[2^(1/nv), 2^(2/nv), ...]`
                - 'linear': linearly distributed scales.
                  !!! EXPERIMENTAL; default scheme for len(x)>2048 performs
                  poorly (and there may not be a good non-piecewise scheme).
        nv: int / None
            Number of voices (CWT only). Suggested >= 32 (default=32).
        t: np.ndarray / None
            Vector of times at which samples are taken (eg np.linspace(0, 1, n)).
            Must be uniformly-spaced.
            Defaults to np.linspace(0, len(x)/fs, len(x)).
            Overrides `fs` if not None.
        fs: float / None
            Sampling frequency of `x`. Defaults to 1, which makes ssq
            frequencies range from 1/dT to 0.5, i.e. as fraction of reference
            sampling rate up to Nyquist limit; dT = total duration (t[-1] - t[0]).
            Overridden by `t`, if provided.
        ssq_freqs: str['log', 'linear'] / np.ndarray / None
            Frequencies to synchrosqueeze CWT scales onto. Scale-frequency
            mapping is only approximate and wavelet-dependent.
            If None, will infer from and set to same distribution as `scales`.
        padtype: str
            Pad scheme to apply on input. One of:
                ('zero', 'symmetric', 'replicate').
            'zero' is most naive, while 'symmetric' (default) partly mitigates
            boundary effects. See `padsignal`.
        squeezing: str['full', 'measure']
                - 'full' = standard synchrosqueezing using `Wx`.
                - 'measure' = as in [4], setting `Wx=ones()`, which is not
                invertible but has better robustness properties in some cases.
                Not recommended unless you know what you're doing.
        difftype: str['direct', 'phase', 'numerical']
            Method by which to differentiate Wx (default='direct') to obtain
            instantaneous frequencies:
                    w(a,b) = Im( (1/2pi) * (1/Wx(a,b)) * d/db[Wx(a,b)] )

                - 'direct': use `dWx`, obtained via frequency-domain
                differentiation (see `cwt`, `phase_cwt`).
                - 'phase': differentiate by taking forward finite-difference of
                unwrapped angle of `Wx` (see `phase_cwt`).
                - 'numerical': first-, second-, or fourth-order (set by
                `difforder`) numeric differentiation (see `phase_cwt_num`).
        difforder: int[1, 2, 4]
            Order of differentiation for difftype='numerical' (default=4).
        gamma: float
            CWT phase threshold. Sets `w=inf` for small values of `Wx` where
            phase computation is unstable and inaccurate (like in DFT):
                w[abs(Wx) < beta] = inf
            This is used to zero `Wx` where `w=0` in computing `Tx` to ignore
            contributions from points with indeterminate phase.
            Default = sqrt(machine epsilon) = np.sqrt(np.finfo(np.float64).eps)

    # Returns:
        Tx: np.ndarray [nf x n]
            Synchrosqueezed CWT of `x`. (rows=~frequencies, cols=timeshifts)
            (nf = len(ssq_freqs); n = len(x))
            `nf = na` by default, where `na = len(scales)`.
        fs: np.ndarray [nf]
            Frequencies associated with rows of `Tx`.
        Wx: np.ndarray [na x n]
            Continuous Wavelet Transform of `x` L2-normed (see `cwt`);
            to L1-norm, `Wx /= np.sqrt(scales)`
        scales: np.ndarray [na]
            Scales associated with rows of `Wx`.
        w: np.ndarray [na x n]
            Phase transform for each element of `Wx`.
